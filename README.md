# Gotcha
Our git repository for Goshen College's gotcha game.

Changes to be made after use:
- No confirmation should be necessary for a "gotten" report
- Users should be emailed if a report asserts they have been killed
- After a length of time (3 hrs?) such reports are automatically applied UNLESS a corresponding dispute has been filed
- Users should be emailed when assigned a new target
- Sanitize mass email input
- Figure out BCC
